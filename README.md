# Mjollnir
A Bias-T cicuit board that handles 10A 60 volts DC.

Frequency range: 160 meters to 70 cm.

It has reverse polarity protection and protection from voltage spikes generated by relays.

The circuit boards are made so they actually are two boards, one injector and one extractor board.

They are easy to separate, as there are a line of closely spaced holes made for that exact purpose.

Voltage indicators should be LED with a proper non inductive current limiting resistor.
